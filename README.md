# APS Problem Sets

## Introduction

This Repo collects my codes for the class Algorithmic Problem Solving at NYU.

Starting from 9.2.2025, I will update a new Problem Set each week as the course progress, and this repo serves as a backup and demonstration for all of my programs.

## Language

Java.

## Acknowledge

The Main.java program at the parent directory serves as a "submission file" to autograder. I will change the content inside constantly, please disregard.
